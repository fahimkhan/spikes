# Here is a sample URL whitelist file
# This is a comment
#
# STRICT - only an exact URL match will be let through, though it is tolerant of trailing slashes
#    ALL - all pages from a specified path will be let through
#        - The * wildcard will do a domain match, but only with the ALL filter
# brooklynmuseum.org = www.brooklynmuseum.org
# JAVASCRIPT - Allow javascript to run on the page (default)
# NOJAVASCRIPT - Block javascript from running on page
# http protocol is assumed other protocols like https:// MUST be specifically added

# SYNTAX FORMAT 
# allowed[HOST, ALL/STRICT, JAVASCRIPT/NOJAVASCRIPT]; 

# use specific protocol if not assuming http:// 
# eg: https://
# most sites today are not using http:// and instead redirect to https:// 
# so ensure the correct protocol for the site you want to filter
# for example you might allow www.google.com but that url redirects to https://www.google.com
# which will be blocked if the https:// protocol is not set here

# Some sample entries:

# using ALL and JAVASCRIPT
allowed[www.mozdevgroup.com, ALL, JAVASCRIPT];

# although an ALL declaration is used above this declaration this will 
# specifically block javascript for this url
allowed[https://www.mozdevgroup.com/dropbox/test/js.html, STRICT, NOJAVASCRIPT];

allowed[www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/, STRICT, NOJAVASCRIPT];

# JAVASCRIPT is enabled by default
allowed[*.brooklynmuseum.org/, ALL];

# JAVASCRIPT is enabled by default
allowed[*.mozdev.org/, ALL];

# only this page will be displayed
allowed[www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/, STRICT, JAVASCRIPT];

# entire site and all subdomains will be allowed with javascript disabled
allowed[https://slashdot.org, ALL, NOJAVASCRIPT];

# entire site and all subdomains will be allowed with javascript enabled
allowed[https://*.google.com, ALL, JAVASCRIPT];

# false positives exist
# sometimes news.google.com loads youtube.com into elements on the page so 
# in order for https://news.google.com to load, you need to enable youtube as well
# entire site and all subdomains will be allowed with javascript enabled
allowed[https://*.youtube.com, ALL];
