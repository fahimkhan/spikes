Stack and Queues are simply arrays with restrictions. Yet, these restrictions are exactly what make them so elegant.

Stack:

1. Data can only be inserted at the end of a stack.
2. Data can only be read from the end of a stack.
3. Data can only be removed from the end of a stack.

Stack follows LIFO rule.


Queues:
1. Data can only be inserted at the end of a queue.
2. Data can only be read from the front of a queue.
3. Data can only be removed from the front of a queue.

It follows the FIFO
