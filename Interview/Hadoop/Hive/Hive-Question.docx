1) What is a Hive Metastore?

Hive Metastore is a central repository that stores metadata in external database.

2) Are multiline comments supported in Hive?

No

3) What is ObjectInspector functionality?

ObjectInspector is used to analyze the structure of individual columns and the internal structure of the row objects. ObjectInspector in Hive provides access to complex objects which can be stored in multiple formats.

4) Explain about the different types of join in Hive.

HiveQL has 4 different types of joins –

JOIN- Similar to Outer Join in SQL

FULL OUTER JOIN – Combines the records of both the left and right outer tables that fulfil the join condition.

LEFT OUTER JOIN- All the rows from the left table are returned even if there are no matches in the right table.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN-All the rows from the right table are returned even if there are no matches in the left table.

5) How can you configure remote metastore mode in Hive?

To configure metastore in Hive, hive-site.xml file has to be configured with the below property –

 hive.metastore.uris

   thrift: //node1 (or IP Address):9083

   IP address and port of the metastore host

 

6) Explain about the SMB Join in Hive.

In SMB join in Hive, each mapper reads a bucket from the first table and the corresponding bucket from the second table and then a merge sort join is performed. Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) join in hive is mainly used as there is no limit on file or partition or table join. SMB join can best be used when the tables are large. In SMB join the columns are bucketed and sorted using the join columns. All tables should have the same number of buckets in SMB join.

7) Is it possible to change the default location of Managed Tables in Hive, if so how?

Yes, we can change the default location of Managed tables using the LOCATION keyword while creating the managed table. The user has to specify the storage path of the managed table as the value to the LOCATION keyword.

8) How data transfer happens from HDFS to Hive?

If data is already present in HDFS then the user need not LOAD DATA that moves the files to the /user/hive/warehouse/. So the user just has to define the table using the keyword external that creates the table definition in the hive metastore.

Create external table table_name (

  id int,

  myfields string

)

location '/my/location/in/hdfs';

9) How can you connect an application, if you run Hive as a server?

When running Hive as a server, the application can be connected in one of the 3 ways-

ODBC Driver-This supports the ODBC protocol

JDBC Driver- This supports the JDBC protocol

Thrift Client- This client can be used to make calls to all hive commands using different programming language like PHP, Python, Java, C++ and Ruby.

10) What does the overwrite keyword denote in Hive load statement?

Overwrite keyword in Hive load statement deletes the contents of the target table and replaces them with the files referred by the file path i.e. the files that are referred by the file path will be added to the table when using the overwrite keyword.

11) What is SerDe in Hive? How can you write your own custom SerDe?

SerDe is a Serializer DeSerializer. Hive uses SerDe to read and write data from tables. Generally, users prefer to write a Deserializer instead of a SerDe as they want to read their own data format rather than writing to it. If the SerDe supports DDL i.e. basically SerDe with parameterized columns and different column types, the users can implement a Protocol based DynamicSerDe rather than writing the SerDe from scratch.

12) In case of embedded Hive, can the same metastore be used by multiple users?

We cannot use metastore in sharing mode. It is suggested to use standalone real database like PostGreSQL and MySQL.
