-------------Analytics Function-------------

	Perform grp by like summarization
	Access data in non sequential way
	count(),sum() used in analytics sense
	resulting row count same as incoming
	Can eleminate intermediate tables
	Also known as window function

	e.g 1. Creating a col contianing row count within gender
			select A.*, 
				Count(*) over (partition by A.gender ) as gender_count
			from  childstat A; 

		2. Running total of wt by gender
			select A.Gender,A.firstname,A.wt
				SUM(A.wt) over (partition by A.gender order by A.wt) AS wt_run
			from childstat A
			group by A.gender,A.wt

	Facts
		--Last SQL operation performed
		--Performed on result on sql query
		-- Not affected by grp by ,Having and Where


	--Partition By Clause
		similar to grp by clause
		break the data into chunks 
		separated by partition biundry
		Function are performed within partition
		Re initialized when crossing partition boundry

	-- Ratio_to_report() function
		Compute ratio of a value to within group total
		Not a percent
		Sum of ratio adds to 1

		e.g 1. Create percent of wt off total wt within gender

			select A.*, 
				100*Ratio_To_Report(wt) over (partition by A.gender ) as pct_wt_gender
			from  childstat A; 

			2. Creating a col containing row counts within gender and birth year
			Note: Use Extract() in Oracle and YEAR in SQL Server

				select A.*, 
					Count(*) over (partition by A.gender,EXTRACT(birthdate) ) as count_gby
				from  childstat A;
