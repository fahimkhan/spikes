-------------------------------Array Sequence--------------------------------------------

1. Array sequence is Supported by list,tuple,string as all can have indexing

2. Individual byte can be stored and retirve in O(1) time

3. Appropriate memory address can be computed using calculation "start +(cellsize)(index)"

4. Referential Array :- Imagine 100 students with ID and name. We want each cell of array to have same number of bytes. To do that we can array of object reference . when  we do slice we actually referencing the object

5. a.extend(b)  here list a is adding only refrence object of b . Not the actual value.


---Dynamic Array : Don't need to specify how large an array is beforehand.


-- Amortization : - Single appending element is O(n) operation. Amortization is performing it efficiently.
