Python provides different arithmetic operators for performing different operations on numerical data.

The list of arithmatic operation used in python is as follow.

x + y	#Addition
x - y	#Subtraction
x * y 	#Multiplication
x / y   #Division
x // y 	#Truncating division
x ** y 	#Exponentiation. Sets x to the power y;
x % y 	#Modulo operator
â€“x 		#Unary minus
+x 		#Unary plus

Please note that x and y are variable name holding proper value. That means you can't do x/y if either of them is string. It will throw an error.

Division :  It return the true integer value. e.g 2/3 = 0.67 will result in integer part of the result i.e 0. However if one of them is floating point it will give floating point result. e.g 2.0/3 = 0.67. But truncating division operator(//) will always return integer part and ignoring remainder no matter if one of them is floating or not.

Exponentiation : To apply exponentiation , you can use double asterisk. e.g a**b. There is in built python function called pow() to calculate the exponentiation. e.g pow(2,3)
