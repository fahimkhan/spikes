Python provides different arithmatic operators for performaing diferent operations on numerical data.

The list of arithmatic operation used in python is as follow.

x + y	#Addition
x - y	#Subtraction
x * y 	#Multiplication
x / y   #Division
x // y 	#Truncating division
x ** y 	#Exponentiation. Sets x to the power y; i.e.,
x % y 	#Modulo operator
â€“x 		#Unary minus
+x 		#Unary plus


Division :  It return the true interge value. e.g 2/3 = 0.67 will result in integer part of the result i.e 0. However if one of them is floating point it will give floating point result. e.g 2.0/3 = 0.67. But truncating division operator will always return integer part and ignoring remainder no matter if one of them is floating or not.

Exponentiation : To apply exponentiation , you can use double asteriks **. e.g a**b. There is in built python function called pow() to calculate the exponentiation. e.g pow(2,3)


Hope you get the idea about arithmatic operation in python. See you in the next tutorial till then "Happy Coding".
