Every programming language has basic elements which are collection of literals,variables and keywords. in this tutorial we will explain what these terms means.

Literals:

It is string or number that directly appears in the program. e.g

15 			#Integer literal
21.0 		#Floating literal
5j  		#Complex number literal
'Hello' 	#String literal
"World"		#String literal

'''
First line
Second line		##Triple quoted string literal
Third line
'''

In python you can use both single or double quote to represent string. For multiple line you can use triple quoted string which again can be single quote or double quote.


Variables:

It is use to store data in a program. To set it you choose the variable name and equate it to value of variable. e.g

a = 10
b = "Hello World!!!"

To know the type of the variable you can use type function as follow.

type(a)

A variable can be start with _ (underscore) e.g

_a = 10

It cannot start with number.

Keywords:
Python has 30 keywords which are identifiers that python reserve for special use.Keywords contain lower case only. you cannot use keyword as regural identifiers. Following are some keywords example.

and, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not


Comments:

Comments are line used for documentation for other programmer to understand the code flow.
A comment begins by a hash sign (#). All characters after the # and up to the physical line end are part of the comment. 
For example,
# This program computes area of rectangle
a = b+c # values of b and c are added and stored in a

Continuation Lines:

A physical line is a line that you see in a program. A logical line is a single statement in Python terms. In Python, the end of a physical line marks the end of most statements, unlike in other languages, where usually a semicolon (;) is used to mark the end of statements. When a statement is too long to fit on a single line, you can join two adjacent physical lines into a logical line by ensuring that the first physical line has no comment and ends with a backslash (\). Besides this, Python also joins adjacent lines
into one logical line if an open parenthesis ( ( ), bracket ( [ ), or brace ( { ) is not closed. The lines after the first one in a logical line are known as continuation lines. The indentation is not applied to continuation lines but only to the first physical line of each logical line.

Printing:

To print on terminal you can use print statement. e.g

print "Hello World"

You can also print the variable value. e.g
a = 10
print "Area of rectangle. "+str(a)

We can use '+' sign to concatenat two string.
